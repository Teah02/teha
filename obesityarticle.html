      <p><strong>The causes and effect</strong></p>
      <p>Childhood obesity is a complex health issue. It occurs when a child is well above the normal or healthy weight for his or her age and height. The causes of excess weight gain in young people are similar to those in adults, including behavior and genetics. Obesity is also influenced by a person's community as it can affect the ability to make healthy choices.</p>
      <p><b>1.	Behavior</b> that influence excess weight gain include eating high-calorie, low-nutrient foods and beverages, medication use and sleep routines. Not getting enough physical activity and spending too much time on sedentary activities such as watching television or other screen devices can lead to weight gain.</p>
      <p>Behaviors that influence excess weight gain include eating high-calorie, low-nutrient foods and beverages, medication use and sleep routines. Not getting enough physical activity and spending too much time on sedentary activities such as watching television or other screen devices can lead to weight gain.</p>
      <p>In contrast, consuming healthy foods and being physically active can help children grow and maintain a healthy weight. Balancing energy or calories consumed from foods and beverages with the calories burned through activity plays a role in preventing excess weight gain. In addition, eating healthy foods and being physically active helps to prevent chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, some cancers, and heart disease.<b>Use these resources to eat well and be active!</b></p>
      <p><b>2.Community Environment</b>It can be difficult to make healthy food choices and get enough physical activity in environments that do not support healthy habits. Places such as childcare centers, schools, or communities can affect diet and activity through the foods and drinks they offer and the opportunities for physical activity they provide. Other community factors include the affordability of healthy food options, peer and social supports, marketing and promotion, and policies that determine how a community is designed.</p>  
      <p><b>Consequences of Obesity </b></p>
      <p><b>More Immediate Health Risks </b>Obesity during childhood can harm the body in a variety of ways. Children who have obesity are more likely to have:</p>
      <p>-High blood pressure and high cholesterol, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.</p>
      <p>-Increased risk of impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.</p>
      <p>-Breathing problems, such as asthma and sleep apnea.</p>
      <p>-Joint problems and musculoskeletal discomfort.</p>
      <p>-Fatty liver disease, gallstones, and gastro-esophageal reflux (i.e., heartburn).</p>
      <p><b>Future Health Risks </b></p>
      <p>-Children who have obesity are more likely to become adults with obesity.11 Adult obesity is associated with increased risk of several serious health conditions including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer.</p>
      <p>-If children have obesity, their obesity and disease risk factors in adulthood are likely to be more severe.</p>

  <div id="wrapper">
    <div id="content">
      <p><strong>What we can do?</strong></p>
      <p>Obesity can happen for a number of reasons, including diet, a sedentary lifestyle, genetic factors, a health condition, or the use of certain medications. A number of treatment options can help people to achieve and maintain a suitable weight.</p>
      <p>Exercise and dietary changes are useful weight-loss tools. For some people, however, these are not effective. In this case, medication or surgery might be an option.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, a health condition  such as a hormonal problem in weight gain. In this case, treating the imbalance can help to solve the problem.</p>
      
      <p><b>1.Dietary changes</b></p>
      <p>Some types of food are more likely to lead to weight gain. Some processed foods contain additives, such as high-fructose corn syrup. This can cause changes in the body that result in additional weight gain.</p>
      <p>Reducing the intake of processed, refined, and ready-made food that is high in sugar and fat, while increasing the consumption of whole grains and other high-fiber foods -such as fresh fruits and vegetables -can help a person to lose weight.</p>
      <p>Fiber and whole grains can also help to reduce the risk of a number of conditions related to metabolic syndrome.</p>
      <p>A doctor or dietitian can help to suggest a strategy and possibly a suitable weight-loss program.</p>
      <p><b>2.Physical activity</b></p>
      <p>Climbing the stairs instead of taking the elevator can be good exercise.</p>
      <p>While the body does burn some calories even when a person is just sitting or sleeping, for most people, the more active they are, the more calories the body will burn.</p>
      <p>People who are not used to exercising or who find it difficult to be active due to health or mobility problems should speak to a health professional about how to exercise and how to get started.</p>
      <p>A person who is not in the habit of exercising should not start with too strenuous an activity, as this could pose a health risk.</p>
      <p><b>3.Weight-loss medications</b></p>
      <p>Side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, such as fatty stool and increased or decreased defecation. Some people have reported unwanted effects on the respiratory system, muscles and joints, and others.</p>
      <p><b>4. Surgery</b></p>
      <p>Weight loss, or bariatric, surgery involves removing or changing a part of a personâ€™s stomach or small intestine so that they do not consume as much food or absorb as many calories as before.</p>
      <p>Gastric sleeve or gastric band-Gastric sleeve or gastric band.After the operation, a person cannot consume more than about one cup of food during each sitting. This significantly reduces food intake.</p>
      <p>Gastric bypass-The procedure enables food to bypass parts of the digestive system, specifically the first part of the mid-section of the small intestine. It may also reduce the size of the stomach.This is generally more effective than restrictive procedures, but there is a higher risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, as the body can no longer absorb as many nutrients.</p>
      <p><b>5.Hormonal Bypass</b></p>
      <p>Harnessing these hormones could lead to novel, non-surgical options.</p>
      <p>The researchers suggest that combining certain hormones might provide an effective therapy.</p>

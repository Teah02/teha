<button class="collapsible">NOVEL CORONA VIRUS (COVID-19)</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The CDC is responding to an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus that was first detected in China and has now been detected in more than 70 locations internationally, including in the United States. The virus has been named “SARS-CoV-2” and the disease it causes has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (abbreviated “COVID-19”).</p>
  <img src="image/covid19.jfif" alt="Covid-19" width="200" height="200">
  <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people, such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus, SARS-CoV-2.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">HIV AIDS</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment.If left untreated, HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).</p>
  <p>AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection that occurs when the body’s immune system is badly damaged because of the virus.Without HIV medicine, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years. Once someone has a dangerous opportunistic illness, life expectancy without treatment falls to about 1 year. HIV medicine can still help people at this stage of HIV infection, and it can even be lifesaving. But people who start ART soon after they get HIV experience more benefits—that’s why HIV testing is so important.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">INSOMNIA</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Insomnia is a sleep disorder in which you have trouble falling and/or staying asleep.The condition can be short-term (acute) or can last a long time (chronic). It may also come and go.Acute insomnia lasts from 1 night to a few weeks. Insomnia is chronic when it happens at least 3 nights a week for 3 months or more.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">ASTHMA</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Asthma occurs when the body’s airways are sensitive to allergens and become inflamed. This inflammation can cause a painful and frightening asthma attack, which causes the airway muscles to tighten and narrow, making it hard to breathe. Most people can manage their asthma very effectively with proper medication. However, asthma left unchecked can be fatal. On average, 3 people die every day from an asthma attack in the UK.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">ARTHRITIS</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Arthritis is the swelling and tenderness of one or more of your joints. The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
  <img src="image/athritis.jfif" alt="Covid-19" width="200" height="200">
  <p>Osteoarthritis causes cartilage — the hard, slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they form a joint — to break down. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the joints, beginning with the lining of joints.</p>
  <p>Uric acid crystals, which form when there's too much uric acid in your blood, can cause gout. Infections or underlying disease, such as psoriasis or lupus, can cause other types of arthritis.</p>
  <p>Treatments vary depending on the type of arthritis. The main goals of arthritis treatments are to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>

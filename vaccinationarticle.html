  <div id="wrapper">
    <div id="content">
      <p><strong>How does it work?.</strong></p>
      <p><b>Vaccines</b> work by training and preparing the body's natural defences -the immunesystem - to recognize and fight off viruses and bacteria. If the body is exposed to those disease-causing pathogens later, , it will be ready to destroy them quickly- which prevents illness. </p>
      <p>When a person gets vaccinated against a disease, their risk of infection is also reduced - so they're also less likely to transmit the virus or bacteria to others. As more people in a community get vaccinated, fewer people remain vulnerable, and there is less possibility for an infected person to pass the pathogen on to another person. Lowering the possibility for a pathogen to circulate in the community protects those who cannot be vaccinated (due to health conditions, like allergies, or their age) from the disease targeted by the vaccine..</p>
      <p>'Herd immunity', also known as 'population immunity', is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when immunity develops in a population either through vaccination or through previous infection. Herd immunity does not mean unvaccinated or individuals who have not previously been infected are themselves immune. Instead, herd immunity exists when individuals who are not immune, but live in a community with a high proportion of immunity, have a reduced risk of disease as compared to non-immune individuals living in a community with a small proportion of immunity. .</p>
      <p>In communities with high immunity, the non-immune people have a lower risk of disease than they otherwise would, but their reduced risk results from the immunity of people in the community in which they are living (i.e. herd immunity) not because they are personally immune. Even after herd immunity is first reached and a reduced risk of disease among unimmunized people is observed, this risk will keep falling if vaccination coverage continues to increase. When vaccine coverage is very high, the risk of disease among those who are non-immune can become similar to those who are truly immune.</p>
      <p>WHO supports achieving 'herd immunity' through vaccination, not by allowing a disease to spread through a population, as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths.</p>
      <p>For COVID-19, a new disease causing a global pandemic, many vaccines are in development and some are in the early phase of rollout, having demonstrated safety and efficacy against disease. The proportion of the population that must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to begin inducing herd immunity is not known.  This is an important area of research and will likely vary according to the community, the vaccine, the populations prioritized for vaccination, and other factors</p>
      <p>Herd immunity is an important attribute of vaccines against polio, rotavirus, pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenza type B, yellow fever, meningococcus and numerous other vaccine preventable diseases. Yet it is an approach that only works for vaccine-preventable diseases with an element of person-to-person spread. For example, tetanus is caught from bacteria in the environment, not from other people, so those who are unimmunized are not protected from the disease even if most of the rest of the community is vaccinated. </p>

      <p>Immunity is the body's way of preventing disease. Children are born with an immune system composed of cells, glands, organs, and fluids located throughout the body. The immune system recognizes germs that enter the body as"foreign invaders" (called antigens) and produces proteins called antibodies to fight them.</p>
      <p>The first time a child is infected with a specific antigen (say measles virus), the immune system produces antibodies designed to fight it. This takes time . . . usually the immune system can't work fast enough to prevent the antigen from causing disease, so the child still gets sick. However, the immune system "remembers" that antigen. If it ever enters the body again, even after many years, the immune system can produce antibodies fast enough to keep it from causing disease a second time. This protection is called immunity.</p>
      <p>It would be nice if there were a way to give children immunity to a disease without their having to get sick first.</p>
      <p><b>In fact there is:</b></p>
      <p>Vaccines contain the same antigens (or parts of antigens) that cause diseases. For example, measles vaccine contains measles virus. But the antigens in vaccines are either killed, or weakened to the point that they don't cause disease. However, they are strong enough to make the immune system produce antibodies that lead to immunity. In other words, a vaccine is a safer substitute for a child's first exposure to a disease. The child gets protection without having to get sick. Through vaccination, children can develop immunity without suffering from the actual diseases that vaccines prevent.</p>
      <p><b>More Facts:</b></p>
      <p>Newborn babies are immune to many diseases because they have antibodies they got from their mothers. However, this immunity goes away during the first year of life.</p>
      <p>If an unvaccinated child is exposed to a disease germ, the child's body may not be strong enough to fight the disease. Before vaccines, many children died from diseases that vaccines now prevent, such as whooping cough, measles, and polio. Those same germs exist today, but because babies are protected by vaccines, we don't see these diseases nearly as often.</p>
      <p>Immunizing individual children also helps to protect the health of our community, especially those people who cannot be immunized (children who are too young to be vaccinated, or those who can't receive certain vaccines for medical reasons), and the small proportion of people who don't respond to a particular vaccine.</p>
      <p>Vaccine-preventable diseases have a costly impact, resulting in doctor's visits, hospitalizations, and premature deaths. Sick children can also cause parents to lose time from work.</p>

<div id="header"><h1><a href="http://www.free-css.com/free-css-layouts.php">5 Myths About The COVID-19 Vaccine That Aren't True</a></h1></div>
  <div id="wrapper">
    <div id="content">
      <p><strong>The myth's.</strong></p>
      <p><b>Vaccines</b> Almost a year after COVID-19 was first seen in humans, vaccines to protect us from the virus are here. (The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were the first to be approved for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration, but more are surely coming.) Scientists and researchers worked quickly and thoroughly to find effective, safe vaccines that could be given to the public in record time</p>
      <p>As supplies are initially limited, not everyone can receive the vaccine right now. Frontline healthcare workers who are caring for COVID-19 patients were among the first to be vaccinated. But once vaccines are available in widespread quantities—which could be by Spring 2021—a large percentage of the public can be vaccinated. That's a critical piece of the puzzle to ensure COVID-19 will no longer be a pandemic that threatens the lives of those in our community and around the world.</p>
      <p><b>The Myth's despite of all rumors we all have been heard</b></p>
     <p><b>1.	Myth: The vaccines aren't safe because they were developed quickly. This is FALSE. </b></p>
      <p>"The COVID-19 vaccines themselves were developed quickly, but the clinical trials, which examine safety and efficacy, weren't rushed at all," Safety was not compromised in any way. What happened quickly was finding the vaccine to test. In the 1980s, it took scientists so long to do this, but thanks to scientific advances we've made over the years, we can find viruses so quickly." Also, he adds, COVID-19 is similar to other coronaviruses we've seen in humans, like MERS and SARS, so there was previous research that could be used to speed up the process.</p>
      <p><b>2.	Myth: The vaccines can lead to long-term effects. This is FALSE</b></p>
      <p>"With vaccines, if there is going to be a complication or side effect (like an allergic reaction, for example) it will occur within minutes to hours of receiving the vaccine," "If we're not seeing serious side effects now, we can pretty much know it will be safe down the road."</p>
      <p><b>3.	Myth: You can get COVID-19 from the vaccines. This is FALSE.</b></p>
      <p>"There's no live virus in the vaccines, so they can't infect you," says "Basically, the vaccines make our bodies produce one single protein from the virus—the protein that infects our cells. By making that protein, we prevent infection. You might have side effects like a headache or chills, but that's because your body is creating an immune response, not because you have an infection."</p>
      <p><b>4.	Myth: I've already had COVID-19, so I don't need to get vaccinated. This is FALSE.</b></p>
      <p>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that those who have had COVID-19 get the vaccine. "There is preliminary evidence that the vaccine offers better protection than having had the virus," "Plus, it's sometimes hard to know whether you actually had COVID-19. People who had COVID-19 in the early days, before we had laboratory testing available, were being diagnosed based upon symptoms and not a test. Also, some of the tests aren't always 100% accurate."</p>
       <p><b>5.	Myth: The COVID-19 vaccines will alter your DNA. This is FALSE.</b></p>
      <p>"The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) to protect us from COVID-19, and I think that is where this rumor comes from," says Dr. Cunningham. "mRNA basically gives our cells the blueprints for the factories that will build the protein to protect us from COVID-19. People get scared that mRNA will cause the virus to go into our DNA and mutate us, but it does not even go into the center part of the cell where we have our DNA."</p>
